# Server demo
Requires rdmd to be installed and accessible via PATH.

In a command prompt run with: `./server.d` (Linux) / `rdmd server.d` (Windows; haven't tested this)

Once running, the command prompt should show `listening on 127.0.0.1:8000`. Every communication made with the displayed address and port will be printed out on the command line. Additionally, when accessing the address with a web browser a "Hello World" page should come up.
